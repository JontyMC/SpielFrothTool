Jailbreak</strong></em>, you want to help prisoners gain their freedom...from your hand. Yes, you have a hand of prisoner cards, and you want to send them through the tunnel so that no one remains behind.</p>

<p>In more detail, from a deck of cards numbered 1-8, with leaders having a value of your choice when you play them, each player starts with a hand of twelve cards and five cards are randomly dealt face up into the &quot;cell&quot;, an area near the deck.</p>

<p>On your turn, if the &quot;tunnel&quot; &mdash; an area in the center of play &mdash; is empty, you can play 1-3 cards. If you play more than one card, those cards must be the same value or in sequential order. (If you play a leader, declare its value if it's not obvious.) If the tunnel isn't empty, you may play the same number of cards as the previous player or one card more or fewer. If you can't play the proper number of cards or don't wish to, you pass, moving all cards in the tunnel to the discard pile.</p>

<p>After passing, draw two cards, whether from the deck, the cell, or a combination; if you played, draw one card, after which you can draw one more, if you wish. (Refill the cell to five cards, if needed.)</p>

<p>One wrinkle to what's above: Before you play or pass, you can &quot;shoot ahead&quot;, that is, add one card to the cards placed in the tunnel by the previous player, adding the same number if they played a set or adding a card to either end of their run. By doing so, you ditch one more card and give you a larger set to play off of.</p>

<p>If you empty your hand, you don't draw and skip all future turns. When 1-2 players have &quot;broken out&quot; &mdash; or daybreak comes at the bottom of the deck &mdash; the round ends; everyone with cards in hand scores points equal to their hand size. After three rounds, whoever has the lowest score wins.</p>

<p><em>AI</em> is a drafting game with a reserve and immediate scoring, all structured around building a tableau.</p>

<p>Drafting with a reserve lets you better prepare your card combinations and chains. Since you immediately score each card played, the reserve lets you optimize your choices and place the best Development card, in the best place, at the best time. <br />
Your AI&rsquo;s performance is measured by scoring various types of Development cards as they are played, in addition to scoring the Original AI&rsquo;s objectives at the end of each round. Finally, at the end of the game, you will gain additional points depending on your AI&rsquo;s specific features.</p>

<p>You will constantly face many challenges, both in terms of creating chains and timing card placement.<br />
After two rounds, the player with the most powerful Artificial Intelligence wins the game.</p>

Now, they must face a challenge: the arrival of new settlers, bringing with them more advanced crafts and technologies, new weapons and fighting techniques, and an entirely different lifestyle.</p>

<p>As the leader of one of the original inhabitants of Altay, how will you react to this challenge? Will you be open to accepting the new settlers and merging with them, or will you focus on your ancient traditions? Will you expand your kingdom or develop new knowledge? Will you build monuments to last forever, or crush your enemies with your armies?</p>

<p><em><strong>Altay: Dawn of Civilization</strong></em> is an original blend of deck-building, civilization development, and area expansion. Players control one of four factions, each represented by a starting deck with unique cards and with subtle differences in the number of &quot;basic&quot; cards. Each turn, players use their cards to produce resources (stone, metal, wood, knowledge), build new settlements and expand on the board, attack or defend against their enemies, or manipulate their decks or card hand.</p>

<p>The game board represents one of the regions where the four people are in conflict with one another, with each area characterized by a different terrain type and the presence of different resources. Card-playing and board expansions are fully integrated, as many cards will have greater effects if you control the right territories. Using the resources produced by their cards or collected from the board, players can acquire and add to their deck new cards, representing the new settlers and their crafts.</p>

<p>Players can also spend resources to develop &quot;achievements&quot; &mdash; special cards that are permanently added to a faction, granting it additional capabilities or providing points.</p>

<p>Victory is granted by the combination of territorial expansion, technological development, and the success in creating long-lasting memories of your civilization's achievements.</p>

The cosmic faculty of the <em>Technical Academy of Creation</em> is delighted to welcome you to your <em>Civolution</em>, the final exam in <em>Civilization Design</em>!</p>

<p>For this occasion, we prepared a humanoid scenario on an isolated continent. Here, each of you holds the rank of a local deity which is closely linked to its very own civilization and must lead it to success over the other civilizations. Your developmental possibilities are endless and reach from cultural and technical progress to evolutional adaptations. For example, what would you consider more beneficial to your tribes: inventing the wheel or growing wings? Demonstrate your ability to operate your civilization console and show us how well you can adjust to changeable environmental conditions and mild creational chaos.</p>

<p>When the exam ceases after four eras, whoever managed to gather the most success points will not only pass the exam but will become a full member of the <em>Technical Academy of Creation</em> and garner the opportunity to be promoted to the next instance.</p>

<p><em><strong>Civolution</strong></em> is a medium heavy to heavy euro-style game that utilizes a dice selection mechanism to trigger actions on a tech tree-like structure. As you figure out how to best use your dice and put your unique cards into play, tons of strategies and paths to victory emerge, though each time you play, you will only explore a fraction of the possibilities that the game&rsquo;s system and many cards provide.</p>

To assert your dominance and ensure victory, dispatch wolves to territories. The stronger wolf wins, strengthening your pack's position &mdash; but despite gaining a scar from the battle and becoming a lone wolf, the weaker one learns from the experience, improving its pack's status for the next encounter. In your struggle, know when to bare your teeth &mdash; and when to go it alone.</p>

<p><em>Lone Wolves</em> is a two-player dueling game with trick-taking and area-majority elements that is played over thirteen rounds (tricks). Players start with thirteen cards, and each trick consists of players playing a single wolf card, of which there are five suits each with cards 2&ndash;7 (thirty cards). The cards, however, are played into one of five territories of your choosing, each awarding points to the player who controls it at game's end. The value of the card represents the strength dispatched to that territory. The winning card in a trick remains face up, while the other player's wolf is flipped to its lone wolf side (with a strength of 1). The owner of the losing card gains a scar token to be placed in a territory, and scar tokens have effects such as awarding points for specific cards played into territories, altering strength values, or affecting points awarded in territories.</p>

<p>Distinguishing itself from most trick-taking games, however, the trump suit in <em>Lone Wolves</em> is dynamic, shifting as the game progresses! Once all scar tokens have been obtained from one territory, the corresponding suit becomes trump; once it happens a second time, the trump suit changes again. The push-and-pull of knowing when to take or lose the trick means that there are no weak hands &mdash; just weak leaders!</p>

<p>In more detail, <em>Panda Spin</em> is a climbing game played with a special deck of &quot;double-headed&quot; cards. All cards start with the orange animals toward the top. Each player receives a random wind card &mdash; each of which has a unique playing condition &mdash; and a hand of eleven cards, with the remaining cards placed in a deck.</p>

<p>During the game, players lay down cards to tricks as singles, in sets, in runs, or in formations (two consecutive pairs, two consecutive triples, etc.) If you're the first player in a trick, lead what you wish other than a bomb, that is, four or more cards of the same value. In turn, players must play a higher matching set of cards, e.g. a higher three-of-a-kind on a three-of-a-kind, or pass, after which they can no longer play in a trick. (A bomb cannot be lead, but can be played on any card combination.)</p>

<p>When you pass, if you've played cards and all of those cards have orange animals at the top, flip the cards so that the blue animals are at top. Each time you flip a card, you change its value depending on its suit: e.g., the water 4 becomes a pair of Qs, the wood 6 becomes a A+bamboo (and each time you play a card with bamboo, you take a bamboo token from the reserve), the earth 8 becomes a Q+panda (with you stealing a bamboo from an opponent for each panda you play), the fire 3 becomes a 10+fire, with the fire being a value of your choice when played.</p>

<p>If you pass and the cards you've played have at least one blue animal, you discard all of those played cards. The winner of the trick always discards all of their played cards, then they lead to the next trick. When you play a wind card &mdash; the south wind, for example, beats a run or formation with 3+ different numbers in it &mdash; you draw two cards from the deck; subsequent players need only beat the card combination played prior to your wind. If you play a wind, you always discard all cards you played to the trick.</p>

<p>When a player runs out of cards &mdash; that is, they &quot;show out&quot; &mdash; they score bamboo equal to how many cards are held by the player with the largest hand. When all but one player have shown out, the round ends, then you shuffle all the cards (including the winds) and deal everyone a new hand. A player immediately wins the game when they have at least twenty bamboo &mdash; but they must score their 20th bamboo by showing out; playing wood and panda cards scores you no bamboo when you have nineteen bamboo.</p>

But as the 19th century ends, change and opportunity reach your fishing village in northern Norway.<br />
In <em><strong>Saltfjord</strong></em>, you must decide if you will expand your settlement with new buildings, send your boat to collect fish, engage in trade, or pioneer new technologies to make everyday life easier. How will you shape the destiny of your village?</p>

<p><em>Saltfjord</em> is set in a Norwegian fishing village, and is loosely based on the dice drafting mechanisms from &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, but the game has otherwise been completely redesigned and expanded with new elements.</p>

<p>To add to the replayability, the game has lots of variable elements in the set-up, such as what special abilities and end scoring tiles are available.</p>

<p>Over three rounds, players draft dice to activate buildings in their settlement. This provides resources as well as activating actions such as sending out your fishing boat, advancing along the various technology tracks, completing trade orders, or erecting new buildings.</p>

<p>Each player's player board shows a grid. When you draft a die, you activate all buildings in the row or column corresponding to that die. By erecting buildings in your settlement, each die can activate more buildings.</p>

The key elements of the game are deck-building and worker-placement, Maybe the most intriguing is the resource management part though. In <em>Tea Garden</em>, you will pay with tea leaves. Those can be either green or black (fermented) &ndash; the value of green leaves decreases each round, but the value of black leaves increases. But you can&rsquo;t gain black leaves directly, you can just change the green leaves to the black leaves. This simple mechanism is vital to the unique dynamics of the game that it&rsquo;s so easy to fall for.</p>

<p>In more detail, at the start of a round reveal twice as many creatures as players in the usual way, then starting with the first player, each player drafts an artifact without their marker on it by placing their marker on that artifact. (In effect, you can't draft the same artifact you had the previous round.) Some artifacts have instant effects you use immediately, others give you a permanent effect that entire round, and others grant you an action that you can use once on a turn. After drafting artifacts, players draft creature cards in the usual way.</p>

<p>When using artifacts, the victory threshold for the game is now 80 points instead of 60, although the game still ends after ten rounds regardless of the score.</p>

<p>To set up, shuffle the deck, deal each player a hand of three cards, reveal six cards and place them in a ring from low to high, then split the deck in half and place these piles in the center of the ring, one face up and the other face down. The deck contains cards numbered 1-126, although you adjust the deck based on the number of players.</p>

<p>On a turn, place a card from your hand between the surrounding numbers in the ring, e.g., 37 between 34 and 52, then you take one of the cards surrounding your just-placed card and add it to your display, either starting a new row or adding to an existing row. (If your card is lower than the lowest number or higher than the highest, place it between the lowest and highest card, then add one of those cards to your display.)</p>

<p>You can have up to three rows in your display. When you place a second card in a row, you must decide whether the cards in that row will be placed in ascending order or descending, and you stack the cards accordingly. If you cannot or do not want to place a card in a row &mdash; following the ascending or descending order you set up &mdash; take all the cards in a row of your choice, flip them face down into a personal discard pile, then start a new row with your current card.</p>

<p>To end your turn, draw a card from either pile inside the ring. Once all the cards in the game have been played, score your rows. For each row, multiply the number of cards in that row by the number of cards in the most common color in that row. For each card in your discard pile, score 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins.</p>

The twists in the game are that you can either win or lose points for winning a trick. You can also win or lose points if you are second in a trick. Who wins or comes second is not always the player who plays the highest value tile; it's actually determined by summing the values of each played suit, then seeing who played the highest tile of the strongest suit.</p>

<p>To add some fun to the mix, you can win a trick with a 2 if you are the only player to play a tile of that suit. Finally, if the game is going really badly for you and you end a hand with exactly zero points, then you can win the game outright if in the next hand, you win five or more points &mdash; from zero to hero!</p>

In addition to this, you must be careful of how you make your way through this earthly world to be sure that Osiris will grant you passage to Aaru, the long-awaited heavenly paradise of the afterlife.</p>

<p>Throughout three eras, by means of a novel selection of actions that combine worker placement and tile drafting, players choose on each turn which area of Egyptian life and culture they wish to develop.

Decades of catastrophic fallout from a nuclear disaster during the Cold War have laid waste to the known world, compelling civilization to seek shelter beneath the earth. The pressing task now is the construction of regenerators, which will generate new habitats to facilitate the resurgence of life and the reclamation of the Earth. A world brimming with hope awaits aboveground.</p>

<p><em><strong>Phoenix New Horizon</strong></em> is a Euro-style board game in which players assume control of a team of commandos tasked with the mission of recolonizing Earth. Throughout the game's four rounds, players accumulate victory points by constructing regenerators and buildings, bolstering the planet's population, and achieving diverse objectives that vary between playthroughs.</p>

<p>Players must adeptly allocate their commandos to various actions throughout the game while also specializing them to enable more potent abilities at the expenses of versatility. Fulfilling missions assigned by the governing authorities yields additional actions on a player's turn.</p>

<p>In <em><strong>Stephens</strong></em>, players compete amongst one another in the role of master glassmakers working at the famous &quot;Stephens&quot; Factory to become the most prestigious figure in town...after Stephens, of course. Through clever and cunning planning, all players will develop their works, invest in new businesses, and promote the creation of jobs. Through a unique action-selection mechanism, on their turn players choose from a variety of options, either by activating the Stephens factory or by activating one of their personal investments.</p>

<p>At the start of play, each player has cars in their color, along with roadways (sticks), gray column pieces, and yellow column pieces. Players set up the city by placing one of their roadways with one end on the table and the other end on a column, then topping it with one of their cars. Next, they take turns placing city objects &mdash; buildings, an airport, a tower, a green area &mdash; around the playing area.</p>

<p>On a turn, expand your highway by adding a new stick to the end of it. When you do so, one end of the stick is placed on the column supporting your most recently played stick and the other end goes on a new column that you add to the table; this new column must contain one more or one fewer column pieces than the column on the other end of the stick. (If you create a column with a yellow piece on top and at least one piece under it, you can break this height restriction rule.)</p>

<p>If you've built this piece of the roadway so that your stick is the first to cross over or go under an opponent's stick, then you score by placing one of your cars on this roadway. If you cross over or go under multiple sticks on the same placement, you place one car per stick you top or bottom!</p>

<p>You can branch once from a column of yours topped with a yellow piece. Also, you can place a stick as an exit ramp if one end is placed on a single column piece and the other end on the table. This piece is automatically topped with a car &mdash; but it's also the final placement for this branch of your highway, so don't get stuck in a dead end.</p>

<p>If you run out of construction materials, you're out of the game. If you're the only one still in the game or you've placed all of your cars, you win.</p>

<p><em>Tokyo Highway: Rainbow City</em> includes a &quot;mission&quot; variant in which all of the basic placement rules apply, but your goal is now to score the most points. Every car placed is worth 1 point, three roadways in a row with cars on them is 2 points, a loop around a building is 1 point, an exit ramp at the airport or green area is worth 2 points, placing the same type of car on a roadway as the opponent's car on the road above/below you is worth 1 point, etc.</p>

<p>In this edition of the game, the roadways have small tacky pads on each end, which makes the sticks more stable than in earlier editions when you placed wood sticks on wood columns.</p>

<p>In <em><strong>Babylon</strong></em>, you take on the role of an eminent architect. Dig the quarry for the best materials, and use them wisely to build your gardens. At the end of the game, the player who unveils the most impressive design before the king will be declared the winner and crowned the greatest architect in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Game system: the box, representing the quarry from which you will draw your construction materials, is placed in the center of the table. On your turn, take a Terrace tile of your choice from the quarry and receive, depending on its location, a variable number of pillars. Use these pillars to place your tile on your personal board and, if you can, beautify your garden with different decorative elements.<br />
Build your terraces to go from floor to floor and decorate them as much as possible. At the end of the game, each decorative element will give you victory points depending on the floor where it is located.</p>

<p>Although BABYLON is accessible to the whole family, it is also very popular with heavy gamers, due to a large number of optimization possibilities.</p>

From all over the kingdom, creatures of all sorts have come with the dream of becoming a champion of this new sport.</p>

<p>The capital is overrun with wannabe players, but as you well know, even the strongest players will not be able to win without a guide. That's why you're here, as part of a group of young coaches who will have to grab the best talent, manage finances, and build the best team. Unfortunately, the competition is fierce, and at the end of the championship, only one will be able to get their hands on the legendary Golden Cup. Will you be the one to triumph in the grand final?</p>

<p><em><strong>Golden Cup</strong></em> takes place over six rounds, plus a finale. Over the course of each round, players play different phases in which they will first try to improve their team, then compete in 1-on-1 matches at the same time on different courts and, depending on the result, acquire the corresponding fame points. At the end of the sixth round, the two players who have earned the most fame points play the finale.</p>

<p><em><strong>Grachtenpand</strong></em> is a light hand drafting game for 2-4 players where you build an idyllic set of canal houses. You build the houses using 'bases', 'floors' and 'roofs'</p>

<p>Each turn, each player simultaneously chooses one card from their hand and builds it, using the rules detailed below.<br />
After building their cards, each player passes the remaining three cards to the player on their left. After receiving a new hand of three cards from the player to their right, each player chooses a type of card (base, front, or roof) and draws one card of that type from the corresponding deck into their hand to refresh it to four cards.</p>

<p>A completed house consists of a base at the bottom, any number of <br />
front cards, and one roof at the top. When building a house, you must build <br />
from the bottom-up (starting with a base and ending with a roof)</p>

<p>When you build a base, you start a new incomplete house by placing it to the left or right of an existing base (or starting your first house if it&rsquo;s the first card you build)</p>

<p>When you build a front, add it to the top of any of your incomplete houses. Once you build a roof, that house is complete, and may not be built any further.</p>

<p>Each player scores points for flowers, colors, bases, and roofs</p>

<p>Flowers: Score 1 point for each window with flowers you have in your tableau</p>

<p>Colors: Find the largest continuous group of cards of one color. Score 1 point for each card in that group.</p>

<p>Bases and Roofs: Each base and roof card in your tableau has a condition and a point value (). If the building this base is a part of meets the condition on the base, you score all the points on the card. If it does not meet the condition, you lose 2 points for this card. Scoring conditions may refer to the number of seagulls, flags, or cats visible on the building. They may also  refer to their own height, or the height of the buildings to their left or right. A building&rsquo;s height is the number of cards in the building (base, fronts, and roof).</p>

Now, you have an opportunity to assemble a coalition of his subjects to take their place. Maybe you'll unite the political power of an entire class, or perhaps build an alliance across the classes. As more subjects join the court, additional strategies may arise.</p>

<p>In <em><strong>King's Coalition</strong></em>, each class has its own abilities and range of influence. Build your coalition by drafting a card, then discarding one from your hand &mdash; but be careful not to give your opponents the exact card they need to make their coalition outpace yours.</p>

<p>You have seven cards in hand to form the strongest coalition to score bonuses that are revealed throughout the game, in addition to trying to create sets and sequences.</p>

<p>The player who can build the strongest coalition will win the king's support...and a place at his side.</p>

Here, rats, weasels and rodents of all kinds gather to play Ratjack. Paws are sweaty, whiskers are quivering, the cards are dealt...it's your turn to play.</p>

<p>Each deck in <em><strong>Ratjack</strong></em> has twelve cards with values from 1 to 12, each with a special ability. A central draw pile is created by shuffling together as many decks as the number of players. Players start with a card face down in front of them and a single card in hand. On their turn, they draw a single card from the central deck, then:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Play a card face down in front of them,</li>
    <li> Play a card face up in front of them and activate its ability, or</li>
    <li> Discard a card to flip over one of their face-down cards and activate its ability.</li>
</ul>

<p>At any point in the game, a player with more than 25 in value in front of them is taken out. Card abilities are interactive effects that allow players to manipulate cards and their value. Players earn points by taking out their opponents &mdash; try to be the last player standing or reach 25 exactly!</p>
